## Introduction
The availability of blood and eyes is crucial for saving lives and restoring sight. However, relying solely on relatives or friends for donations is not sufficient to meet the demand. Existing blood and eye banks in Bangladesh face challenges in promptly connecting patients with donors, as their manual systems are often inefficient and unreliable. We aim to solve this problem as a third-party helper by providing an automated and user-friendly platform. Our system ensures quick and reliable access to organs by streamlining the communication between patients and blood/eye banks, eliminating the need for direct patient-donor contact. With our system, patients can be confident that their requests for blood or eye donations will be fulfilled promptly.

## Problem Statement
The problem is the inadequate supply of blood and eye donations in Bangladesh, which often results in patients relying on family and friends for donations that are not always reliable or sufficient. Moreover, the current donation systems are inefficient, not user-friendly, and often doesn’t work properly which can lead to delays in treatment and potentially life-threatening situations.Additionally, there is a lack of guarantee that patients will receive the necessary blood or eye donations when urgently needed.

## Specialty of this system
In bangladesh available blood or eye donation bank system working style like One to One, such as patient to donor or patient to one blood or eye donation bank. So this type of system give us less Guarantee to get blood or eye. But Blood and eye bank system working style like One to Many, here many blood and eye donation bank register their account. This system give us more Guarantee to get blood and eye. In this system have delivery option also. Since this system give more Guarantee and there have no system like my blood and eye donation bank system in bangladesh you can choose my project.

## Conclusion

### Project Summary
Finally, the need for blood and eye donation is crucial for patients in Bangladesh, as
many lose their lives due to the unavailability of these essential resources. The current
system of donation banks in the country is not efficient, as it works manually and
lacks user-friendliness. As a third-party helper, our automated system ensures that
patients can quickly find the required blood or eye and receive it through a delivery
feature. With our system, patients can contact the donation bank directly, and the bank
can contact donors promptly, reducing the chances of unavailability during
emergencies. Our system provides a guarantee to patients that they will receive the
needed blood or eye, addressing the urgent and vital need for these resources in
Bangladesh.

### Limitation
As I am at the entrance level of development, I cannot fulfill my system with all
usable feature. In my project there are some limitations, that is:

● There are some feature I can’t add to this system.
● It is only web based application, no mobile or desktop application is not
develop yet.

● This is basic microservice based application, there are so many technology in
microservice which I can’t use for hardware limitation.

### Obstacles And Achievements
The way I passed through to develop this application was full of challenges, too many
obstacles overcome to come to end. Perhaps challenges allow us to prove ourselves.
Obstacles challenges, overcoming challenges and obstacles achievements draw a path
to success. When I started this project, I face security problem. In microservice
architecture use auth server which I don’t know how to implement. Then I learn
spring security in JWT. I got problem in frontend development. I am a backend java
spring boot developer. In frontend I only know HTML and CSS. So that’s why I first
learn Vue Js for frontend development. Then I develop frontend. After 6 month of
hard work, I overcome all of these challenges and problem and now my system
successfully develop. All of my system component work perfectly. If the user feel
easy to use this system, this will be my biggest achievement.
