          An eye donation bank is a crucial institution that facilitates the
          noble act of restoring vision and transforming lives. These banks
          serve as repositories for donated eyes, which are then carefully
          evaluated, preserved, and allocated for corneal transplantation
          surgeries. By encouraging individuals to pledge their eyes for
          donation after death and raising awareness about the importance of eye
          donation, these banks play a vital role in reducing blindness and
          enhancing the quality of life for countless individuals. Their
          selfless work offers hope and the gift of sight to those in need,
          truly embodying the spirit of compassion and generosity.
